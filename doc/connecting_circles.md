go to connect mode (press `c`) then drag from one circle to another:

you see that we've created a `0 -> 0` connection. we can change the connection in place by selecting each hole, pressing `l` then typing a link type, then pressing enter.

i've made it a `n -> h` connection (number controlling the hue)
then `n -> r` (number controlling the radius)

while in connect mode, you can see the command line displaying `-- CONNECT -- (0 0)` that indicates the type of connection we will make when dragging. this can be changed by pressing `c` and then typing 2 link type characters back to back. here i typed `n` then `o` and you can see that the connection i made after that was indeed of type `n -> o` (number controlling rotation)

(any unacceptable characters will translate to link type 0)
